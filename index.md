# Draft Federal Grants Management Data Standards for Feedback 
        
Welcome to the Draft Grants Management Data Standards Feedback portal! The Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross Agency Priority Goal Team is soliciting feedback on the Federal Grants Management **Draft** Data Standards to develop and implement core grants management data elements and modernize information technology solutions. This information will be used to contribute to a future state where grants data are interoperable, there are fewer internal and public-facing grants management systems, and Federal awarding agencies and recipients leverage data to successfully implement a risk-based, data-driven approach to managing Federal grants. **These data standards are a pre-decisional draft and should not be interpreted as setting policy or official guidance.**

## Overview
Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal is one of several CAP Goals established to drive the implementation of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/" target="_blank">Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda</a>. The PMA lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people. 

**The Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP Goal seeks to:**

* Enable agencies to clearly articulate grant program goals and the results Federal Grant Investments
* Enable recipients and agencies to spend less time on administrative compliance
* Increase focus and efforts to achieve and report program results 
    
## Data Standards 
Today, the Federal government does not have a robust, integrated approach to use the multitude of data generated throughout the grants lifecycle. To bring grants management to the digital age and allow recipients to focus more time on performing work that delivers results, there is a need to develop and implement core grants management data standards and modernize grants management information technology solutions.  The Grants Management Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) has developed core grants management data standards that are being published here for your feedback.  Your contribution will contribute to a future state where grants data are interoperable, there are fewer internal and public-facing grants management systems, and Federal awarding agencies and recipients leverage data to successfully implement a risk-based, data-driven approach to managing Federal grants.
