        <p>
            The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Office of Federal
            Financial Management (FIT) is participating in the development of
            government-wide business standards. Those standards are:

        <h4 class="mt-0">Federal Financial Management Business Data Elements</h4>

        <p>The goal of this initiative was to identify the critical FFM business data elements.  These elements have been deem mandatory in order to execute an agency’s FFM business capabilities. To complete this, FIT worked with a Federal Financial Management Working Group (FMWG) to review and refine these Data Elements. FMWG members included representation from the CFO Act agencies, OMB, GSA Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) Office, and the Department of Treasury.</p>
        <p>FM community has done considerable work already and that work is memorialized in both the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) and the Fiscal Service Data Registry (FSDR).</p> 
        <p>This effort focused on whether there were additional elements beyond those memorialized in DAIMS or FSDR. This review is for the elements defined beyond those in DAIMS or FSDR.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-0">We have identified 531 FFM Data Elements:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>92 Elements from the DAIMS;

            <li>408 Elements from the FSDR;

            <li><a href="./data-elements">27 New Elements and Definitions (see below)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mt-0">We are asking the FFM Community to weigh in on the selected data elements:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Are they appropriately named?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are the definitions accurate?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the Authoritative Reference(s) listed correct and comprehensive?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mt-0">Also, after reviewing all 527 of the identified critical FFM data elements:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Are these the correct critical FFM data elements?</li>
            <li>Are we missing any critical data elements?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The definitions and information for these elements are available on the <a href="/data-elements">Data Elements Page</a>
