        <p>
            The Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross Agency Priority Goal Team is excited to announce that a <strong>public comment page</strong> for the <strong>draft</strong> Grants Management Data Standards are expected to be released in November 2018. 

The <strong>draft</strong> Grants Management Data Standards will be pre-decisional, not to be interpreted as setting policy or official guidance. 

As a valued stakeholder, we invite you to join the discussion and provide feedback. 

Below is background on the Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal and the upcoming <strong>draft</strong> Data Standards.

<h3>Overview</h3
<p>The <u>Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal</u> is one of several CAP Goals established to drive the implementation of the <u>Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda (PMA)</u>. The PMA lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people. <p>

<p>
<strong>The Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP Goal seeks to:</strong>
<li>Enable agencies to clearly articulate grant program goals and the results Federal Grant Investments</li>
<li>	Enable recipients and agencies to spend less time on administrative compliance</li>
<li>	Increase focus and efforts to achieve and report program results</li>
</p>
To support progress towards this goal, drafts of the <strong>Data Standards</strong> will be released for public comment. 

<h3>Data Standards </h3>

Today, the Federal government does not have a robust, integrated approach to use the multitude of data generated throughout the grants lifecycle. To bring grants management to the digital age and allow recipients to focus more time on performing work that delivers results, there is a need to develop and implement core grants management data standards and modernize grants management information technology solutions.  The Grants Management Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) has developed core grants management data standards that are being published here for your feedback.  Your contribution will contribute to a future state where grants data are interoperable, there are fewer internal and public-facing grants management systems, and Federal awarding agencies and recipients leverage data to successfully implement a risk-based, data-driven approach to managing Federal grants.
