        <h2 class="mt-0">Federal Financial Management (FM) Standard Data Elements</h2>
        <p>
            Treasury’s Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) is the Line of Business (LoB) Managing
            Partner for the Federal Financial Management (FM) service area. FIT has developed a set of reference
            documents to help guide agencies in improving the cost, quality, and performance of Federal financial
            activities and solutions. Those references include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/p6/c950.html" target="_blank">Federal Financial Management
                    System Requirements (FFMSR)</a>: defines financial system standards and reporting requirements
                capabilities, with references to underlying standards and regulations
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/fit/FMFunctionsandActivities.pdf"
                   target="_blank" download>Federal Financial Management Functions & Activities List</a>: defines a
                taxonomy of FM capabilities and services, with references to OMB Circular A-11 and the FFMSR
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/fit/fit_usecase.htm" target="_blank">Federal
                    Financial Management Business Use Cases</a>: establishes a system agnostic view of the flow of

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>FIT also identified 527 FM Standard Business Data Elements which reflect the data elements needed to meet the
            requirements defined in the FFMSR. Included in this inventory are elements that have already been defined in
            either the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) or the Fiscal Service Data Registry (FSDR):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>92 Elements from the DAIMS;
                <a href="http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/dictionary-v1.2" target="_blank">DAIMS v1.2</a>;
                <a href="assets/downloads/DAIMS_DEs.xlsx" target="_blank" download>FFM Data Elements from DAIMS</a>
            </li>
            <li>408 Elements from the FSDR; 
                <a href="https://www.transparency.treasury.gov/dataset/data-registry/registry#meta-data"
                   target="_blank">FSDR</a>;
                <a href="assets/downloads/FSDR_DEs.xlsx" target="_blank" download>FFM Data Elements from FSDR</a>
            </li>
            <li>27 <a href="./data-elements">New Elements and Definitions (see below)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To that end, FIT is soliciting feedback on the inventory of the FM Standard Data Elements in order to improve
            its accuracy and clarity. Consider the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For the 27 new standard data elements identified and defined</strong> (27 definitions and
            information for these elements are available on the <a href="/data-elements">Data
            Elements Page</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Are they appropriately named?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are the definitions accurate?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the Authoritative Reference(s) listed correct and comprehensive?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Also, after reviewing all 527 of the identified critical FFM data elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are these the correct critical FFM data elements?</li>
            <li>Are we missing any critical data elements?</li>
        </ul>
